Video on Zephyr
###############

.. warning::

   The boards presented here have not all been tested with all
   use-cases, and support for some hardware is still a work in
   progress.

.. warning::

   The speeds are directly out of the datasheet. It is typically
   not possible to reach the max spead for any system, but it
   gives an idea of the class of device they belong to.

A presentation to show the diversity of hardwrare that can run
Zephyr today.

Terms that might need to be explained.

:NPU:
   Neural Processing Unit: core computes efficiently large grid of
   small numbers (i.e. 8-bit, 4-bit...), supported operations needed
   for neural network inference (the last step of "A.I.").

:IMU:
   Inertial Measurement Unit: Sensor that detects change in
   orientation and movements, useful for estimating the motion or
   position of a device.
